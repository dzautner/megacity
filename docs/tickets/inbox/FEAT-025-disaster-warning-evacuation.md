**Category:** Feature / Disasters
**Priority:** T3
**Source:** community_wishlists.md -- Section 8.1, 8.2

## Summary

Early warning systems (sirens, alerts), evacuation routes and shelter-in-place orders. Evacuation simulation (citizens flee via designated routes). Rebuild mechanics (cleanup, reconstruction, insurance claims). Terrain-aware disasters (floods follow elevation, earthquakes on fault lines).

## Details

- Early warning: sirens reduce casualties, evacuation time
- Evacuation routes: designated paths to shelters
- Insurance system: damage costs offset by premiums
- Rebuild grants / federal aid after disasters
- Terrain-aware: floods follow elevation, wildfires follow vegetation/wind

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Warning systems reduce casualties
- [ ] Evacuation routes functional
- [ ] Rebuild mechanics with insurance/aid
- [ ] Disasters interact with terrain realistically
