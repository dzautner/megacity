# END-021: Bureaucratic Inertia and Administrative Scaling

**Category:** Endgame / Late-Game Challenge
**Priority:** T3
**Source:** endgame_replayability.md -- Bureaucratic Inertia

## Summary

As cities grow, administrative overhead increases super-linearly. Implement permit/approval mechanics that scale with population: direct action (<10K), basic review (10K-50K), community input (50K-100K), full review process (100K-200K), bureaucratic complexity (200K+). Major projects face delays, community opposition, and council votes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Project approval time scales with city population
- [ ] Community input can delay projects
- [ ] Council vote mechanic for major projects
- [ ] Fast-track option costs political capital
