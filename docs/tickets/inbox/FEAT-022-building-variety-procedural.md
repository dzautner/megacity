# FEAT-022: Building Variety and Procedural Generation

**Category:** Feature / Visual
**Priority:** T2
**Source:** community_wishlists.md -- Section 7.1 (EXTREMELY HIGH frequency)

## Summary

Many more building models per zone level to avoid repetition. Procedural building generation using modular components for automatic variation. Regional architectural styles (European, Asian, Middle Eastern). Historical period styles (Victorian, Art Deco, Modern). Building aging/weathering over time.

## Details

- Modular building system: base, floors, roof, facade elements mixed procedurally
- At least 10-20 variants per zone level
- Regional style sets assignable per district
- Historical style sets for era progression
- Visual aging (weathering, patina) over time
- District theme enforcement (all buildings match style)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No visible repetition at normal zoom
- [ ] Procedural variation from modular components
- [ ] At least 2 regional architectural styles
- [ ] Building aging visible over time
