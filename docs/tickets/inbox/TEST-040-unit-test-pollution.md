# TEST-040: Unit Tests for Pollution Simulation

## Priority: T1 (Core)
## Effort: Small (0.5 day)
## Source: testing_strategy.md -- Section 2: Unit Testing

## Description
Test pollution generation from industrial buildings, pollution dissipation over time, wind effect on pollution spread direction.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test industrial building generates pollution in surrounding cells
- [ ] Test pollution dissipates over time
- [ ] Test pollution levels in [0, 255] (or equivalent range)
- [ ] Test wind direction affects pollution spread
