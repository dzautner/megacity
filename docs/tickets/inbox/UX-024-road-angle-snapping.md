# UX-024: Road Angle Snapping (15-Degree Increments)

## Priority: T2 (Depth)
## Effort: Small (1 day)
## Source: camera_controls_ux.md -- Section 12.6: Road Snapping

## Description
When Shift is held during road placement, constrain angle to 15-degree increments (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90). Makes precise diagonal roads easy.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Shift key activates angle snapping
- [ ] Snaps to nearest 15-degree increment
- [ ] Visual indicator of snapped angle
- [ ] Releases to free angle when Shift released
