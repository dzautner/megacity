**Category:** Endgame / Mega-Project
**Priority:** T4
**Source:** endgame_replayability.md -- Mega-Projects as Endgame Goals

## Summary

Vast underground network combining metro transit with underground shopping, services, and residential space (Montreal RESO / Tokyo style). Requires population > 150K, suitable geology, existing transit. Expands transit capacity without consuming surface land.

## Details

- Phases: geological survey (6mo), tunnel boring (2-4yr), station construction (1-2yr/station), commercial development, underground parks
- Creates weather-protected pedestrian connections
- Reduces surface traffic
- Significant maintenance costs (ventilation, water management, emergency access)
- Security challenges in underground spaces

## Dependencies

- Transit system
- Economy
- Underground rendering system

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Underground network constructible in phases
- [ ] Metro stations with commercial development
- [ ] Underground pedestrian connections functional
- [ ] Surface traffic reduction measurable
