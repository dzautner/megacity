# END-020: Housing Crisis and Affordability Mechanics

**Category:** Endgame / Late-Game Challenge
**Priority:** T3
**Source:** endgame_replayability.md -- Housing Crisis and Affordability Mechanics

## Summary

City success creates housing crisis: success attracts people, demand raises prices, prices exclude essential workers. Model supply/demand housing market, filtering, gentrification displacement, and homelessness mechanics. Housing types: single-family, missing middle, mid-rise, high-rise, public housing.

## Details

- Supply/demand affects prices: demand > supply = price rise = lower-income squeeze
- Gentrification: improving neighborhoods raises values, displaces existing residents
- Housing types with different density, cost, political protection levels
- Missing middle housing (duplex/triplex/townhouse) as key policy lever
- Homelessness drivers: cost burden > 50%, job loss, health crisis, eviction
- Homelessness effects: visible encampments, service demand, political controversy
- Response options: shelters, affordable housing, housing-first, enforcement, prevention
- Rent burden metric: % of income spent on housing per citizen

## Dependencies

- Citizen system (income tracking)
- Land value (drives prices)
- Building system (housing types)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Housing market with supply/demand pricing
- [ ] Gentrification displacement modeled
- [ ] Multiple housing types with different characteristics
- [ ] Homelessness emerges from affordability failure
- [ ] Policy responses available (shelters, public housing, rent control)
