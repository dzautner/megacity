# END-032: Suburban Sprawl Consequences

**Category:** Endgame / Urban Planning
**Priority:** T3
**Source:** endgame_replayability.md, community_wishlists.md

## Summary

Low-density suburban expansion should have realistic consequences: expensive infrastructure per capita, long commutes, car dependency, environmental impact, fiscal insolvency (suburban Ponzi scheme). Contrast with dense urban development.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Per-capita infrastructure cost higher in suburbs
- [ ] Suburb commute times increase with distance
- [ ] Suburban fiscal balance tracked (often negative)
- [ ] Dense development more fiscally productive per acre
