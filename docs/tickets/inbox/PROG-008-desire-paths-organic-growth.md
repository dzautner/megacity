# PROG-008: Desire Paths and Organic Growth (Foundation inspired)

**Category:** Progression / Urban Development
**Priority:** T4
**Source:** indie_competitors.md -- Foundation, Ostriv

## Summary

Citizens create worn paths where official paths don't exist. Dirt roads form naturally where people walk most. Housing emerges organically influenced by terrain and trade routes. Neighborhoods develop outward from activity centers, not from roads and zones alone.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Pedestrian desire paths visible on terrain
- [ ] Informal paths can be upgraded to roads
- [ ] Organic settlement patterns near attractions
