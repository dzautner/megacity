# TEST-039: Unit Tests for Utility BFS Coverage

## Priority: T1 (Core)
## Effort: Small (1 day)
## Source: testing_strategy.md -- Section 2: Unit Testing

## Description
Test power and water BFS flood-fill: coverage propagates along roads, disconnected areas have no coverage, coverage stops at grid boundaries.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test power coverage from power plant along roads
- [ ] Test water coverage from water tower along roads
- [ ] Test disconnected area has no coverage
- [ ] Test coverage does not cross gaps
- [ ] Test coverage respects grid boundaries
