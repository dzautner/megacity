# INFR-004: Power Generation Mix (Coal/Gas/Solar/Wind/Nuclear)
**Priority:** T2
**Complexity:** M
**Dependencies:** INFR-001
**Source:** cities_skylines_analysis.md, section 10; master_architecture.md, section M3

## Description
Implement diverse power generation options with different cost/capacity/pollution tradeoffs. Each power plant type has distinct characteristics that create interesting gameplay decisions.

- Coal: 100MW, cheap ($2000), high pollution, requires coal import
- Natural Gas: 50MW, moderate ($3000), moderate pollution
- Solar: 10MW, expensive ($4000), zero pollution, output varies with weather/day-night
- Wind: 15MW, moderate ($3500), zero pollution, output varies with wind speed
- Nuclear: 200MW, very expensive ($15000), zero pollution, risk of meltdown (disaster?)
- Geothermal: 30MW, moderate ($5000), zero pollution, requires specific terrain
- Power plants have maintenance cost, age, and capacity degradation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] 5+ power plant types with distinct characteristics
- [ ] Solar/wind output varies with conditions
- [ ] Pollution generated by fossil fuel plants
- [ ] Power plants age and degrade capacity
- [ ] Player can build optimal power mix for budget/environment goals

## Test Plan
- Unit: Coal plant provides 100MW and generates pollution
- Unit: Solar output at night = 0
- Integration: City powered entirely by solar goes dark at night (needs backup)

## Pitfalls
- Solar/wind variability creates power intermittency (need battery/backup mechanic?)
- Nuclear meltdown could be too punishing for a casual player
- Power plant placement affects pollution and noise for nearby buildings

## Relevant Code
- `crates/simulation/src/services.rs:ServiceType` -- power plant variants
- `crates/simulation/src/pollution.rs` -- power plant pollution
- `crates/simulation/src/utilities.rs` -- power supply per plant type
