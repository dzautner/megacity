# FEAT-066: Induced Demand Modeling for Roads

**Category:** Feature / Transportation
**Priority:** T2
**Source:** community_wishlists.md -- Section 20.1 (HIGH frequency)

## Summary

Building more roads generates more traffic (induced demand). New highway capacity fills within a few game years. Widening roads provides temporary relief but long-term traffic increase. Forces mode shift to transit at scale. Stroads (street-road hybrids) modeled as dangerous and inefficient.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] New road capacity attracts additional traffic over time
- [ ] Road widening provides diminishing returns
- [ ] Transit investment reduces car demand
- [ ] Stroad concept modeled with negative effects
