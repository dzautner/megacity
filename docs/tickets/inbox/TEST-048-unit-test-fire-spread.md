# TEST-048: Unit Tests for Fire Spread Mechanics

## Priority: T1 (Core)
## Effort: Small (0.5 day)
## Source: testing_strategy.md -- Section 2: Unit Testing

## Description
Test fire spread logic: fire spreads to adjacent buildings, fire station coverage reduces spread, fire extinguishes over time with coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test fire spreads to adjacent cells
- [ ] Test fire spread rate proportional to building density
- [ ] Test fire station coverage reduces spread
- [ ] Test fire extinguishes with adequate coverage
