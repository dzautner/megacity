# FEAT-006: Parking Simulation

**Category:** Feature / Transportation
**Priority:** T3
**Source:** community_wishlists.md -- Section 1.5

## Summary

Realistic parking: citizens seek parking rationally, parking policy controls (minimums/maximums/pricing per district), multi-story parking garages, car dependency consequences (excessive parking reduces walkability/livability), parking lots waste valuable land.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Parking demand modeled per zone
- [ ] Parking policy controls per district
- [ ] Parking garages constructible
- [ ] Surface parking affects land value negatively
