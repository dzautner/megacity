# FEAT-063: Wind-Aware Pollution Dispersion

**Category:** Feature / Environment
**Priority:** T2
**Source:** master_architecture.md -- Section 1.11

## Summary

Replace simple neighbor diffusion with wind-aware pollution dispersion. Gaussian plume model approximation. Wind direction and speed affect pollution spread direction. Technology upgrades reduce emissions (scrubbers, catalytic converters). Urban heat island effect.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Pollution spreads in wind direction
- [ ] Wind speed affects dispersion distance
- [ ] Technology upgrades reduce source emissions
- [ ] Downwind areas affected more than upwind
