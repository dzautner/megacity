**Category:** Endgame / Mega-Project
**Priority:** T4
**Source:** endgame_replayability.md -- Mega-Projects as Endgame Goals

## Summary

Create new land in harbor/coastal waters when city runs out of land. Requires coastal location, population > 200K. Multi-year construction provides blank canvas for modern development in premium waterfront location.

## Details

- Phases: study (1-2yr), seawall (1-2yr), land reclamation (2-4yr), infrastructure (1-2yr), development
- Iconic visual element (Palm Jumeirah / Chek Lap Kok style)
- Can be designed from scratch with no legacy constraints
- Vulnerable to sea level rise and storm surge
- Environmental cost to marine ecosystem

## Dependencies

- Terrain system (coastal/water)
- Economy (massive funding)
- Bridge/tunnel connections to mainland

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Artificial island constructible on coastal maps
- [ ] New buildable land appears through construction
- [ ] Bridge/tunnel connects to mainland
- [ ] Island vulnerable to climate events
