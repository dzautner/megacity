# UX-075: Building Construction Animation

## Priority: T2 (Depth)
## Effort: Medium (2-3 days)
## Source: rendering/building_render.rs

## Description
Buildings under construction should have a visual construction animation: scaffolding mesh, progressive build-up, crane prop. Currently construction may just show the final building immediately or a placeholder.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Under-construction buildings show scaffolding mesh
- [ ] Progressive build-up animation over construction duration
- [ ] Optional crane prop during construction
- [ ] Smooth transition from construction to completed building
