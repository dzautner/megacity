# AUDIO-011: Crisis and Event Music Response

**Category:** Audio / Music
**Priority:** T4
**Source:** sound_design.md -- Section 3.6

## Summary

When disasters occur, music responds immediately but musically. Tension stem fades in (2 bars), melodic fades out, harmonic shifts to minor key, then section transitions to Tension. Disaster-specific musical elements: tornado (tremolo strings), earthquake (timpani, sub-bass rumble), flood (rising strings), fire (staccato), epidemic (sustained dissonance), budget crisis (instruments removed one-by-one).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Crisis triggers tension stem within 1 bar
- [ ] Melodic stem suppressed during crisis
- [ ] Disaster-specific musical elements play
- [ ] Gradual recovery sequence (8-16 bars) after crisis ends
