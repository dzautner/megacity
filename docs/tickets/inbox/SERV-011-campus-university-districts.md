# SERV-011: Campus/University District System
**Priority:** T3
**Complexity:** L
**Dependencies:** SERV-003, SERV-007
**Source:** cities_skylines_analysis.md, section 14.8

## Description
Implement university campus districts modeled after CS1's Campus DLC. Draw campus boundary, place academic buildings, campus levels up based on student count and academic output.

- Campus types: Trade School, Liberal Arts, University
- Campus leveling: L1 (500 students), L2 (1000), L3 (2500), L4 (5000), L5 (10000)
- Academic works: generated by labs, libraries, lecture halls over time
- Campus buildings: dormitories, faculty offices, stadiums, gyms, labs
- Varsity sports: revenue and happiness from athletic events
- Campus graduates feed education pipeline (SERV-003)
- Land value bonus around campus

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Campus district paintable
- [ ] Campus leveling based on students and academic output
- [ ] Campus buildings functional
- [ ] Graduate output to education pipeline
- [ ] Land value bonus

## Test Plan
- Integration: Build campus, enroll 500 students, verify L1 achieved

## Pitfalls
- Student enrollment requires age-appropriate citizens choosing university
- Academic works are a new tracking metric (count accumulated over time)
- Stadium events need scheduling system

## Relevant Code
- `crates/simulation/src/districts.rs` -- campus district type
- `crates/simulation/src/education.rs` -- student enrollment
- `crates/simulation/src/services.rs` -- campus service buildings
