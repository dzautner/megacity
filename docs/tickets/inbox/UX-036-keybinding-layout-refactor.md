# UX-036: Resolve Keybinding Conflicts

## Priority: T1 (Core Polish)
## Effort: Small (1-2 days)
## Source: camera_controls_ux.md -- Section 14.3: Keybinding Conflicts

## Description
Current keybindings have conflicts: P=Power overlay vs Policies, E=Education overlay vs camera rotation, T=Traffic overlay vs Transit, 1-9=tools vs speed. Resolve by moving overlays to Tab-cycling and restructuring tool shortcuts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No keybinding conflicts
- [ ] 1-3 for speed (Space for pause)
- [ ] R/Z/B/I/V for tool categories
- [ ] Q/E for camera rotation
- [ ] Tab for overlay cycling
- [ ] Letter keys freed for panels (J=journal, C=charts, A=advisor, P=policies)
