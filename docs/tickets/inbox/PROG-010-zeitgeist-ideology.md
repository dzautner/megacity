# PROG-010: Zeitgeist / City Ideology System (Frostpunk 2 inspired)

**Category:** Progression / Governance
**Priority:** T4
**Source:** indie_competitors.md -- Frostpunk 2

## Summary

Three ideological axes: Adaptation/Progress, Equality/Merit, Reason/Tradition. Laws, buildings, and decisions push city along axes. Zeitgeist direction makes aligned policies easier to enact. Creates emergent city identity/personality. Factions form dynamically when Zeitgeist develops.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Ideological axes tracked
- [ ] Decisions shift city on axes
- [ ] Aligned policies easier to pass
- [ ] City develops emergent political identity
