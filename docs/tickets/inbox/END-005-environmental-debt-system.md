# END-005: Environmental Debt and Climate Escalation

**Category:** Endgame / Late-Game Challenge
**Priority:** T3
**Source:** endgame_replayability.md -- Environmental Debt and Climate Escalation

## Summary

Implement cumulative environmental damage that accumulates invisibly and manifests at thresholds. Environmental debt = sum of industrial emissions + vehicle emissions + energy emissions + waste + water extraction + impervious surfaces - green infrastructure - cleanup efforts. Five escalating thresholds from Awareness to Existential.

## Details

- Three temporal scales: immediate (smog, noise), medium-term (soil contamination, groundwater), long-term (sea level rise, climate change)
- Cumulative debt ledger tracking all pollution sources and mitigation
- Threshold 1 (Awareness): reports and complaints
- Threshold 2 (Health Effects): illness rates rise, property values drop
- Threshold 3 (Crisis): contaminated water, fish die-offs, smog emergencies
- Threshold 4 (Systemic): tourism/business decline, insurance costs rise
- Threshold 5 (Existential): areas become uninhabitable
- Brownfield problem: prime industrial land contaminated, expensive to clean

## Dependencies

- Pollution system (exists)
- Health system
- Economy/Budget

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Environmental debt ledger accumulates over time
- [ ] Five threshold levels with escalating consequences
- [ ] Brownfield sites tracked on former industrial land
- [ ] Cleanup/remediation options available at significant cost
- [ ] Climate change increases extreme weather frequency over time
