# END-008: Mega-Project -- Mega-Dam / Hydroelectric Complex

**Category:** Endgame / Mega-Project
**Priority:** T4
**Source:** endgame_replayability.md -- Mega-Projects as Endgame Goals

## Summary

Massive dam providing flood control, water supply, hydroelectric power, and recreation. Requires river terrain, population > 100K. 6 construction phases over 4-8 years. Involves controversial land acquisition and environmental impact.

## Details

- Phases: feasibility (1-2yr), land acquisition/relocation (6-12mo), river diversion (6mo), construction (2-4yr), reservoir filling (6-12mo), operation
- Eliminates downstream flooding, provides renewable electricity and water supply
- Creates reservoir for recreation and tourism
- Environmental cost: riverine ecosystem disruption
- Ongoing safety/maintenance requirements (dam failure would be catastrophic)

## Dependencies

- Terrain system (river required)
- Economy (funding)
- END-003 (environmental opposition)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dam constructible on river terrain
- [ ] Multi-phase construction with visible progress
- [ ] Reservoir fills and provides water/power
- [ ] Flood prevention downstream
