# TEST-057: Unit Tests for Road Maintenance and Degradation

## Priority: T2 (Depth)
## Effort: Small (0.5 day)
## Source: testing_strategy.md -- Section 2: Unit Testing

## Description
Test road degradation based on traffic volume and weather. Test maintenance cost calculation. Test road condition affects travel speed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test road condition degrades with traffic
- [ ] Test road condition degrades faster in bad weather
- [ ] Test maintenance cost proportional to road count and condition
- [ ] Test poor road condition increases travel cost
