# FEAT-074: Scripting API for Modding

**Category:** Feature / Modding
**Priority:** T4
**Source:** game_design_mechanics.md -- Section 11.3

## Summary

Five API layers for modders: Data API (read/write game state), Event API (subscribe to events), UI API (custom panels/overlays), Rendering API (custom shaders/effects), Simulation API (custom simulation systems). Scripting language (Lua/Rhai/WASM) for simple mods. Stable versioned API.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Data API for reading/writing game state
- [ ] Event API for subscribing to game events
- [ ] UI API for custom panels
- [ ] Scripting language integration
- [ ] API version stability
