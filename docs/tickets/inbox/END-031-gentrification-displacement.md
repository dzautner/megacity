**Category:** Endgame / Social
**Priority:** T3
**Source:** endgame_replayability.md -- Housing Crisis

## Summary

Neighborhood improvement raises property values, displacing lower-income residents. Displacement causes homelessness, longer commutes (priced out to far suburbs), community disruption. Anti-displacement policies available but have economic costs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Neighborhood investment raises local rents
- [ ] Lower-income residents displaced when rent > affordability
- [ ] Displaced residents move to cheaper areas or become homeless
- [ ] Anti-displacement policy options (rent stabilization, affordable housing mandates)
