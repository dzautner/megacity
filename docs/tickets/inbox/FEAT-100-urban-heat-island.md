# FEAT-100: Urban Heat Island Effect

**Category:** Feature / Environment
**Priority:** T3
**Source:** master_architecture.md

## Summary

Dense urban areas with impervious surfaces (asphalt, concrete) create heat islands: higher temperatures than surrounding areas. Affects energy demand (more AC), health, comfort. Green infrastructure (trees, green roofs, parks) mitigates. Temperature overlay showing heat distribution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dense areas show higher temperature
- [ ] Heat island increases AC demand
- [ ] Green infrastructure reduces heat island
- [ ] Temperature overlay available
