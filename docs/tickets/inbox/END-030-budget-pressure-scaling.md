# END-030: Budget Pressure Scaling with City Size

**Category:** Endgame / Budget
**Priority:** T3
**Source:** endgame_replayability.md -- Budget Pressure

## Summary

Reverse the typical pattern where budgets get easier as cities grow. Per-capita costs increase with city size due to bureaucratic overhead, service complexity, infrastructure maintenance, union demands. Revenue challenges: economic cycles, tax competition, tax base sensitivity.

## Details

- Expense escalation: infrastructure maintenance grows super-linearly, public employee unions demand higher wages, pension obligations grow, social services scale with inequality, debt service constrains spending
- Revenue challenges: tax base sensitive to economic cycles, wealthy residents demand tax breaks, tax increases face political resistance
- The "doom loop": can't build transit -> traffic worsens -> pollution worsens -> health costs rise -> budget worsens

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Per-capita costs increase with city size
- [ ] Budget surplus becomes harder to maintain at scale
- [ ] Revenue subject to economic cycle volatility
- [ ] Cascading budget pressures from interacting systems
