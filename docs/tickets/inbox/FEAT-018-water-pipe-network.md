# FEAT-018: Water and Sewage Pipe Network

**Category:** Feature / Infrastructure
**Priority:** T2
**Source:** community_wishlists.md -- Section 5.1, master_architecture.md

## Summary

Explicit pipe network (or auto-follow-road hybrid). Water pressure, pipe capacity, sewage treatment capacity. Stormwater drainage (separate or combined). Aging pipes requiring maintenance. Underground view for pipe management.

## Details

- Pipes auto-follow roads by default (reduce tedium) with capacity limits
- Water pressure zones and distribution modeling
- Sewage network separate from water supply
- Stormwater drainage (separate = clean, combined = overflow risk)
- Pipe aging, breaks, and maintenance
- Underground view toggle for pipe management

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Water distribution with capacity limits
- [ ] Sewage network functional
- [ ] Pipe aging and breaks
- [ ] Underground view for pipe management
