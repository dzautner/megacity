# END-022: Legacy Infrastructure Constraints

**Category:** Endgame / Late-Game Challenge
**Priority:** T3
**Source:** endgame_replayability.md -- Legacy Infrastructure Constraints

## Summary

Early-game road layouts and infrastructure constrain late-game development. Street grid lock-in, utility corridor congestion, building footprint lock-in. The "Big Dig" scenario: core infrastructure simultaneously outdated, undersized, and surrounded by dense development.

## Details

- Road widening requires demolishing adjacent buildings (cost + displacement)
- New through-routes through existing neighborhoods face opposition
- Utility corridors under roads become congested
- Small lot sizes from early development prevent modern construction
- Freeway removal dilemma: rebuild, bury, remove, or do nothing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Road modifications in built-up areas require demolition
- [ ] Demolition costs scale with building value and displacement
- [ ] Utility capacity constraints modeled
- [ ] Freeway removal options available
