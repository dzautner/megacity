# UX-069: Day/Night Cycle Visual Controls

## Priority: T2 (Depth)
## Effort: Small (1 day)
## Source: camera_controls_ux.md, rendering/day_night.rs

## Description
Expose day/night cycle controls: time-of-day slider, cycle speed, option to lock at specific time (always daytime for building). Current day_night.rs exists but has no player controls.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Time-of-day slider in settings or toolbar
- [ ] Lock time option (freeze at specific hour)
- [ ] Cycle speed: normal, fast, disabled
- [ ] Settings persist across saves
