# PROG-003: Edict/Policy System with Tradeoffs (Tropico inspired)

**Category:** Progression / Governance
**Priority:** T3
**Source:** indie_competitors.md -- Tropico 5/6

## Summary

Laws/proclamations with positive effects AND negative trade-offs. Three-tier scaling (edicts improve while active). Era-specific edicts unlock through research. Policies create binding consequences. Some policies fundamentally change gameplay (free vs paid healthcare).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Policies have explicit positive and negative effects
- [ ] Policy effects scale over time
- [ ] Era-specific policy unlocks
- [ ] Policy choices create meaningful tradeoffs
