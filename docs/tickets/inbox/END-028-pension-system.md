**Category:** Endgame / Budget Pressure
**Priority:** T3
**Source:** endgame_replayability.md -- The Pension Bomb

## Summary

City hires employees (police, fire, teachers) and promises pensions. For decades, pensions cost nothing. 20-30 years later, retirees accumulate and pension payments become massive budget item crowding out current services. Detroit-style pension crisis as late-game challenge.

## Details

- Track cumulative pension obligations from all city employees hired
- Pension payments begin when employees retire (triggered by age)
- Unfunded liabilities grow if pension fund contributions are deferred
- Pension reform as political option (reduces future benefits, current retirees grandfathered)
- Pension obligations can exceed current service budgets

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Pension obligations tracked per city employee cohort
- [ ] Pension payments grow as employees retire
- [ ] Budget pressure from pensions visible in budget UI
- [ ] Pension reform policy option available
