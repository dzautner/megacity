# END-029: Crime Escalation Driven by Inequality

**Category:** Endgame / Late-Game Challenge
**Priority:** T3
**Source:** endgame_replayability.md -- Crime Escalation

## Summary

Upgrade crime system beyond simple police coverage. Crime driven by income inequality (Gini coefficient), unemployment (especially youth), population density without services, proximity to blight, poor urban design. Scales from petty crime (5K) through organized crime (25K-50K) to structural crime (200K+).

## Details

- Crime drivers: inequality, unemployment, density, blight, urban design
- 5K-25K: petty crime, burglary -> police, lighting
- 25K-50K: organized crime if high inequality -> social services, education
- 50K-100K: gang territories, drug trade -> community policing, economic development
- 100K-200K: white-collar crime, corruption -> oversight, transparency
- 200K+: structural multi-generational poverty -> heavy policing vs root-cause intervention
- Crime reduces land value (feedback loop), increases emigration, creates political tension

## Dependencies

- Crime system (exists, needs deepening)
- Wealth/inequality tracking (exists)
- Land value system

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Crime driven by inequality and unemployment, not just police coverage
- [ ] Crime type and severity scales with city size
- [ ] Crime-land value feedback loop functional
- [ ] Root-cause interventions available as alternative to policing
