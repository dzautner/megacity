# END-027: Construction Disruption System

**Category:** Endgame / Infrastructure
**Priority:** T3
**Source:** endgame_replayability.md -- Construction Disruption

## Summary

Major infrastructure replacement is not instant. Projects go through planning, preparation, demolition, construction, and commissioning phases. During construction: traffic diverted, service intermittent, noise/dust affect nearby properties, land value temporarily reduced. Creates scheduling challenge: balance urgency vs disruption.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Major projects have multi-phase construction timeline
- [ ] Construction zones visually show barriers, equipment, workers
- [ ] Nearby properties experience reduced happiness and land value
- [ ] Traffic automatically rerouted around construction
- [ ] Player manages construction scheduling across city
