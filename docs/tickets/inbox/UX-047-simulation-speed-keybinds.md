## Priority: T1 (Core Polish)
## Effort: Small (0.5 day)
## Source: camera_controls_ux.md -- Section 14.2: Keybindings

## Description
Remap speed controls: Space = toggle pause/play, 1 = 1x, 2 = 2x, 3 = 4x. Currently number keys map to tools. Tools should use letter keys.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Space toggles pause/play
- [ ] 1 = speed 1x
- [ ] 2 = speed 2x
- [ ] 3 = speed 4x
- [ ] Tool hotkeys moved to letter keys
