# UX-054: Satellite View at Maximum Zoom-Out

## Priority: T2 (Depth)
## Effort: Medium (2-3 days)
## Source: camera_controls_ux.md -- Section 8: Zoom LOD Tiers

## Description
At maximum zoom-out, render the city as a 2D satellite-style top-down view: terrain color map, road lines, building blobs. Transitions smoothly from 3D view.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Satellite-style rendering at far zoom
- [ ] Terrain base colors visible
- [ ] Roads as thin lines
- [ ] Buildings as colored area fills
- [ ] Smooth transition from 3D to satellite view
