# END-024: Economic Competition and Regional Dynamics

**Category:** Endgame / Late-Game Challenge
**Priority:** T3
**Source:** endgame_replayability.md -- Economic Competition

## Summary

Model the city within a region with AI-controlled neighboring cities, suburban communities, and rural hinterland. Competition for residents, businesses, investment, talent, and funding. Economic cycles (expansion, peak, contraction, trough) with semi-random timing.

## Details

- AI neighboring cities growing/declining independently
- Business attraction/retention: businesses evaluate tax rate, labor, infrastructure vs neighbors
- Resident migration: citizens compare housing, schools, safety, commute with alternatives
- Tax competition: race-to-the-bottom dilemma
- Commuter patterns crossing city boundaries
- Economic cycles: 3-5yr expansion, 1-3yr contraction, variable severity
- City diversification affects recession resilience

## Dependencies

- Economy system
- Immigration system (exists)
- Trade connections (exists)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AI neighboring cities modeled abstractly
- [ ] Business relocation threats functional
- [ ] Economic cycles create periodic challenges
- [ ] Regional competition for residents
