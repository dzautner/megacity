- Scenario sharing via workshop
- Per-scenario leaderboards
- Multi-scenario campaigns with branching paths

## Dependencies

- Save/Load system
- All core simulation systems

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Scenarios loadable with pre-built city state
- [ ] Win/lose conditions evaluated
- [ ] Star rating system
- [ ] Scenario editor functional
- [ ] Community sharing supported
