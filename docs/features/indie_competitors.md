Exhaustive catalog of unique/innovative mechanics from indie and alternative city builders.
Focus is on features NOT found in Cities: Skylines that could differentiate a new city builder.

---

## 1. Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic

### Production Chain Depth
- Over 30 distinct commodities with full extraction-to-finished-good chains
- Grain -> flour -> bread; crops -> fabric -> clothes; iron ore -> steel -> steel beams
- Each commodity has specific storage types (tanks for liquids, aggregate storage for ores, warehouses for finished goods)
- Factories halt when output storage is full -- backpressure propagates through the chain
- Factory input/output can be extended by connecting additional external storage or warehouses

### Logistics & Transportation Granularity
- Specific vehicle types required per commodity class (tankers for liquids, flatbeds for aggregates, covered trucks for goods)
- Conveyor belt networks with input/output slot connections, conveyor engines for long runs
- Pipeline networks with pumping stations for liquids
- Forklift garages for short-distance inter-building hauling
- Trains, cargo planes, cargo helicopters all usable for freight
- Custom airport design (runway length determines aircraft types)
- Train signal placement and scheduling
- Loading/unloading stations specific to commodity type (pumping stations for oil, aggregate loaders for gravel)
- Underground infrastructure variants (pipes, conveyors, wiring) with adjustable depth

### Planned Economy & Dual Currency
- Rubles (internal) and Dollars (external trade) as separate currencies
- Trade with both Western Bloc and Soviet Bloc -- non-aligned nation positioning
- Global market prices fluctuate based on simulated events
- Import/export at border crossings and customs houses

### Citizen Simulation
- Education pipeline: kindergartens -> schools -> universities; uneducated workers cannot fill skilled jobs

- Fulfilling needs directly affects workplace productivity
- Crime simulation with full justice system (police, courts, prisons) as toggleable feature
- Party loyalty mechanic

### Seasonal Systems
- Seasons affect farming output, heating demand, road conditions, outdoor leisure
- Heating is a survival requirement in winter -- coal/oil must be stockpiled
- Seasonal electricity demand fluctuations

### Adjustable Complexity
- Toggle individual simulation systems on/off: seasons, crime, complex education, traffic
- Traffic simulation complexity levels (simple priority vs. full simulation)
- Education complexity levels (auto-educate vs. manual school management)

### Construction System

- Factions form dynamically when city Zeitgeist develops enough
- Faction relations range from Devoted to Hostile
- High relations: rallies, bonuses, unique faction abilities
- Low relations: protests, district occupation, riots
- Trust influenced by gifts (Heatstamps), promises, policy alignment

### Zeitgeist System (FP2)
- Three ideological axes: Adaptation/Progress, Equality/Merit, Reason/Tradition
- Laws, buildings, and decisions push city along these axes
- Zeitgeist direction makes aligned laws easier to pass

- All progress through resource chain balancing
- Three tiers of work: Unskilled, Skilled, High-Skilled
- Education produces higher-tier workers for advanced buildings

### Puzzle-Like Building Placement
- Buildings have placement requirements relative to surroundings
- Buildings upgrade based on neighbor buildings and resource proximity
- Negative placement effects (pollution near housing degrades it)
- Placement optimization is the core strategic challenge

### No Superior Buildings Design
- Every building has trade-offs (no strictly better options)
- Bourgeois houses: consume more but improve quality of life
- Industrial buildings: produce more but reduce nearby quality of life
- Forces genuine strategic choices rather than linear upgrades

### Organic City Growth
- Buildings emerge and upgrade based on surrounding conditions
- Dense areas with basic services spontaneously grow taller buildings
- City evolution feels natural rather than player-directed

### Biome-Specific Content
- ~20% of buildings unique to each biome
- Three distinct victory conditions per biome
- Completing biomes in any victory path unlocks new biomes
- Replayability through biome/victory combinations

### Voxel World Exploration
- Voxel art style
- Drop into world and walk around
- See your city from ground level

### No Disasters
- Deliberately excludes random disaster events
- All challenge comes from resource management and placement optimization
- Purely strategic rather than reactive gameplay

## 17. City State / City State 2

### Deep Political Simulation
- 51 policies with 204 distinct options covering full political spectrum
- Custom Policy Creator for designing and enacting new laws
- Policies affect "social ladder index"
- All political ideologies playable (left to right, authoritarian to libertarian)

### Stats-Based (Not Agent-Based) Simulation
- No individual citizen simulation
- Focus on macro-economic systems affecting entire country
- Deeper economic complexity possible without per-citizen overhead
- Four economic sectors: Retail, Office, Basic Manufacturing, Advanced Manufacturing

### Immigration as Core Mechanic
- Immigration policy as primary population growth driver
- Early cities rely almost entirely on immigration (low birth rates)
- Must balance immigration rate with job/housing availability
- Too much immigration = poverty, unemployment, riots
- Better city management allows higher immigration rates

### Religion & Birth Rate Simulation
- Religion simulated as social factor
- Birth rates affected by policies and social conditions
- Political affiliations simulated across population

### Per-Building Budget Control
- Independent budget settings per building (schools, hospitals, etc.)
- Buildings can be extended to increase capacity
- Staff quantity affects service quality
- Granular control over public service delivery

### Three Play Styles
- Ideological experiment: pick a political ideology, try to make it work
- Optimization: find best policy combination for maximum growth
- Casual: ignore politics entirely, just build

### Dynamic Negative Events
- Riots from policy failures
- Fires, plane crashes
- Organized crime emergence
- Slum formation and urban decay
- Bankruptcy from fiscal mismanagement

### Education-Driven Economy
- Education levels determine which businesses can operate
- Under-educated population cannot support high-value industries
- Education investment has long-term economic payoff
