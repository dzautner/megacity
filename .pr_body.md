## Summary
- add true headless record mode for `--replay ... --record ...` by running with `WindowPlugin.primary_window = None`
- render replay camera into an offscreen `RenderTarget::Image` and capture frames from that image
- skip UI and interactive egui-dependent rendering systems in headless record mode to avoid window/context dependencies
- keep existing screenshot behavior unchanged for normal windowed runs

## Why
`--record` previously still depended on `Screenshot::primary_window()`, which could open a game window. This change records directly from an offscreen target so video generation can run with no visible game window.

## Notes
- existing asset-path warnings during replay capture are unchanged in this PR
